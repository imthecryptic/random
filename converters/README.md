## Simple python scripts to convert inputted numbers between bases

[convert-manual](convert-manual.py): this script converts between denary and binary numbers where i designed the algorithm myself to convert them, rather than using built-in python functions

[convert-custom](convert-custom.py): this script uses built-in python functions to allow the user to customise what base they want their input and output in
